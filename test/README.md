To test:

Can either use a notebook or the .py. They will both create a video and print the mot metrics results.
In the notebook I have also put the traning data.


They both use tracker_test.

A test run the testing_step function from tracker_test for each frame of a video, with the frame as input. 

Also, with the ground truth detections as input I get really good results, I am not sure what this means. To try this just uncomment the line in the notebook in the cell where I run the training data tests.
